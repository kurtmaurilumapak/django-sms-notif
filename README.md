This Django application includes a *Score* model that stores numeric results as positive small integers and integrates Twilio's messaging API for real-time SMS notifications. When a score falls below a predefined threshold (default is 70), the application automatically sends an SMS notification to a predefined phone number, alerting the recipient about the low score. The system includes configurable Twilio credentials, error handling with retry logic for failed notifications, and logs all sent messages for auditing purposes. This feature is useful for applications that need to provide immediate feedback on low scores or performance metrics.
